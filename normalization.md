## Normalization
### first form
Ensures that each column contains atomic values (no repeating groups or arrays) and each row is unique.

### second form
Ensures that the table is in 1NF and that all non-key attributes are fully dependent on the primary key (no partial dependencies).

### third form
Ensures that the table is in 2NF and that all attributes are directly dependent on the primary key (no transitive dependencies).
